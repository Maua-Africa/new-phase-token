                        <p>Risks
                            1. Development failure or abortion. Acquiring and storing Delinquent Utility Tokens involves
                            various risks, in
                            particular that Coalichain may not be able to launch some operations and continue developing
                            its
                            platform or community. Therefore, and prior to acquiring Delinquent, any user should
                            carefully consider
                            the risks, costs, and benefits of acquiring Delinquent within the Token Sale, and, if
                            necessary, obtain
                            independent advice in this regard. Any interested person who is not in the position to
                            accept nor to
                            understand the risks associated with the activity (incl. the risks related to the
                            non-development of
                            Coalichain network and operations) or any other risks as indicated in the T&C, should not
                            acquire
                            Delinquent, at this stage or later.
                            2. Legal Risk concerning Security Regulation. There is a risk that in some jurisdictions
                            Delinquent Utility
                            Tokens might be considered as a security, now or in the future. Company does not give
                            warranties
                            or guarantees that Delinquent Utility Token are not a security in all jurisdictions. Each
                            user of Delinquent shall
                            bear its own legal or financial consequences of Delinquent Utility Token being considered a
                            security in
                            their respective jurisdiction. The legal ability of Company to provide Delinquent Utility
                            Tokens in some
                            jurisdictions may be eliminated by future regulation or legal actions. In the event, it
                            turns out with a
                            high degree of certainty that Delinquent Utility Tokens are not legal in certain
                            jurisdiction, Company will
                            base on its sole discretion either (a) cease operations in that jurisdiction, or (b) adjust
                            Delinquent Utility
                            Tokens in a way to comply with the regulation should that be possible and viable. It is your
                            obligation to check if acquisition and disposal of Delinquent Utility Tokens is legal in
                            your jurisdiction, and
                            by accepting these Terms you expressly agree and warrant that you will not use Delinquent
                            should their
                            use not be legal in the relevant jurisdiction.
                            3. Risk of malfunction of blockchain. Nobody can guarantee the smart contract source code
                            used by
                            Company will be flaw-free. It may contain certain flaws, errors, defects and bugs, which may
                            disable
                            some functionality for users, expose users’ information or otherwise. Such flaw would
                            compromise
                            the usability and/or security of Company and consequently bring adverse impact on the value
                            of
                            Company open source codes rely on transparency to promote community-sourced identification
                            and solution of problems within the code.
                            4. Update of the Source Code. The smart contract source code could be updated, amended,
                            altered or
                            modified from time to time by the developers and/or the community of smart contract . Nobody
                            is
                            able
                            to foresee or guarantee the precise result of such update, amendment, alteration or
                            modification.
                            As a result, any update, amendment, alteration or modification could lead to an unexpected
                            or
                            unintended outcome that adversely affects Delinquent Utility Tokens and/or Company operation
                            or
                            market value.
                            5. Internet transmission risks. You acknowledge that there are risks associated with
                            utilizing an
                            Internet-based digital assets, products and website including, but not limited to, the
                            failure of
                            hardware, software, and Internet connections. You acknowledge that the Company shall not be
                            responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you
                            may
                            experience when using our services, website, platform, Delinquent Utility Tokens howsoever
                            caused.
                            6. Cryptography risks. You acknowledge that there are risks associated with cryptography,
                            such as
                            code cracking or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could
                            present risks to all crypto-currencies including Delinquent Utility Tokens. This could
                            result in the theft, loss,
                            disappearance, destruction or devaluation of Delinquent. To a reasonable extent, Company
                            will be
                            prepared to take proactive or remedial steps to update the protocol underlying Company in
                            response to any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional reasonable security
                            measures where appropriate. It is impossible to predict the future of cryptography or the
                            future of
                            security innovations to an extent that would permit the Company accurately guide the
                            development of Company to take into account such unforeseeable changes in the domains of
                            cryptography or security.

                            7. Forking. smart contract is an open source project and supported by the community. The
                            developers of
                            the Company do not lead the development, marketing, operation or otherwise of smart contract
                            .
                            Anybody may develop a patch or upgrade of the source code of smart contract ’s source
                            without prior
                            authorization of anyone else. The acceptance of smart contract patches or upgrades by a
                            significant, but
                            not overwhelming, percentage of the users could result in a “fork” in the blockchain of
                            smart contract ,
                            and consequently the operation of two separate networks and will remain separate until the
                            forked
                            blockchains are merged. The temporary or permanent existence of forked blockchains could
                            adversely impact the operation and the market value of the Delinquent and in the worst case
                            scenario,
                            could ruin the sustainability of the Company. While such a fork in the blockchain of
                            smart contract
                            would possibly be resolved by community-led efforts to merge the forked blockchains, the
                            success
                            is not guaranteed and could take long period of time to achieve.
                            8. Risk of unfavorable regulatory action in one or more jurisdictions. Blockchain
                            technologies have
                            been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world. Delinquent could
                            be impacted
                            by one or more regulatory inquiries or actions, including but not limited to restrictions on
                            the use
                            or possession of Delinquent, which could impede or limit their existence, permissibility of
                            their use and
                            possession, and their value.
                            9. Risk of theft and hacking. Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to
                            interfere with
                            your third-party wallet, the Website or the availability of Delinquent Utility Tokens in any
                            number of ways,
                            including without limitation denial of service attacks, Sybil attacks, spoofing, smurfing,
                            malware
                            attacks, or consensus-based attacks.
                            10. Risk of mining attacks. smart contract blockchain, which is used for the Delinquent
                            Utility
                            Tokens, is susceptible
                            to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power
                            attacks,“selfish-mining”attacks, and race condition attacks. Mining Attacks, as described
                            above,
                            may also target other blockchain networks, with which Delinquent interacts with. Any
                            successful attacks
                            present a risk to the Delinquent Utility Token.
                            11. Risk of loss of value and uninsured losses. Value of Delinquent Utility Tokens may
                            fluctuate and you may
                            suffer loss in value of such acquired Delinquent Utility Token. In addition to loss of value
                            risk, Delinquent Utility
                            Tokens are entirely uninsured and are unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other
                            financial
                            institutions.
                            12. Unanticipated risks. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies are new and untested
                            technology an in addition to the risk outlined in these Terms, there are also unforeseeable
                            risks that
                            may materialize as unanticipated.
                            13. You acknowledge, agree and warrant that you have been warned of the potential risks
                            involved by
                            using our services, website and product and other relevant technologies mentioned herein as
                            well
                            as that there may be other risks involved, which are not specified herein and that you fully
                            accept
                            such risks.
